    <h1>Hey WindBorne, I'm Arnold!</h1>

        Below was my attempt to host a static website accessible from outside my local network. However, when setting a NAT forwarding on the router, I realized that my router WAN IP is private, and therefore, I would need to access the upstream NAT device to set the port forwarding.
        However, this is not possible to do, since I live in an apartment building where I do not have access to the main router for access purposes. I'll therefore host this page on a GitHub page and copy (below) the content of my static website (as it appears when I run it locally). I hope you'll understand my situation and determination to complete this task despite the obstacle I faced. Thank you.

    <p>This static webpage is hosted on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, shown in the image above, which I access through SSH.</p>
    
    <h2>My Setup</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Installed Apache server using the command <b>sudo apt-get install apache2</b>.</li>
        <li>Set my port number to listen on 13542 (just to avoid conflicts with the most popular/default port number 80).</li>
        <li>Edited <code>/var/www/html/index.html</code> to write the content of this webpage.</li>
    </ul>
